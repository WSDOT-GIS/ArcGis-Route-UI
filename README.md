ArcGIS Routing UI
=================

When this project is completed it will provide a UI for the following ArcGIS REST API services.

* [Route service with synchronous execution]
* [Route service with asynchronous execution]

## Why not just use Esri's [Directions dijit]? ##

While the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript] does have a [Directions dijit], this dijit does not provide the ability to use all of the different options on the route service.

## Resources used ##
* [Esri's resource-proxy]
